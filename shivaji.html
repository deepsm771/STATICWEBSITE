    <h2 class="pad-5 text-center">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus</h2>
    <p> Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (officially Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus since 2017, formerly Victoria Terminus, Bombay station code: CSMT (mainline)/ST (suburban)), is a historic railway terminus and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai, Maharashtra,
        India. The terminus was designed by a British born architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens from an initial design by Axel Haig, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori
        Bunder railway station, and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule. In March 1996 the station name was changed from Victoria Terminus to "Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus" (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the
        17th-century warrior king and the first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire who founded the state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau. In 2017, the station was again renamed "Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus" (with
        code CSMT), where the title Maharaj has literal meaning, "Great king; emperor." Both former initials "VT" and the current, "CST", are also commonly used. The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway
        stations in India, serving as a terminal for both long-distance and suburban trains with a total number of 18 platforms.</p>
    <h2> History</h2>

    <p>
        <br>This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.

        <br>The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger
        station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British born engineer architect, attached to the Bombay
        office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received ₹1,614,000 (US$20,000) as the payment for his services.[1] Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by
        draughtsman Axel Haig.[1] The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott's 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to[1][13] Scott's second prize winning entry for Berlin's
        parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome.[14] The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Mumbai, such as the Elphinstone
        College but especially the buildings of Mumbai University, also designed by G Scott.

        <br>The station took ten years to complete,[13] the longest for any building of that era in Mumbai.

        <br> During its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main façade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings
        and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India.[15] Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed Rani Baug) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at
        least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed.[16] The symbol of Progress,
        another statue, featured on the top of the dome, is often mistaken for that of Queen Victoria.

        <br>Renaming Victoria Terminus, before being renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in 1995 Victoria Terminus, before being renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in 1995 The station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori
        Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888, and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus[17][18] in honour
        of Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire. In December 2016, the Fadnavis Ministry passed a resolution to change the name to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the Maharashtra Assembly and in May 2017, the home ministry officially sent a
        letter to the state government denoting the name change, following which the station was yet again renamed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, both the former names "VT" as well as "CST" along with the current name "CSMT" are
        popularly used.[19][20]

    <h2>2008 Mumbai attacks</h2>
    <p>Main article: 2008 Mumbai attacks On 26 November 2008, two Pakistani terrorists entered the passenger hall of the CST, opened fire and threw grenades at people. The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was later
        caught alive by the police and identified by eyewitnesses. The others did not survive. The attacks began around 21:30 when the two men entered the passenger hall and opened fire,[21][22] The attackers killed 58 people and injured 104 others,[22]
        their assault ending at about 22:45 after they exited the station via the North FOB towards the west to Cama hospital back entrance. The CCTV evidence was used to identify and indict Kasab.[21] In 2010, Kasab was sentenced to death for his role
        in the attack, and in 2012 he was hanged.[23]</p>
